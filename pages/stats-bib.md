## Undergraduate Statistics Bibliography ##
written on 2013-06-02, edited on 2014-01-26

The below is an annotated bibliography for studying statistics. My hope is that it can be useful for those interested in a rigorous undergraduate-level statistics education. I've found that nothing beats pen, paper, and a *good* textbook when it comes to really learning a subject (as much as I love MOOCs). Books are listed in roughly descending order of difficulty within each subject area. This is inspired by the [Chicago undergraduate mathematics bibliography](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~abhishek/chicmath.htm). 

Reviews not marked with initials, or marked with [RW], were written by me. Other contributors include: [Jonathan Hersh [JH]](https://twitter.com/jonhersh_) and [Nelson Auner [NA]](nelsonauner.com). Please do let me know if you'd like to add a blurb.

** Foundations: Probability **

*Ross, A first course in probability:* The title is perfectly descriptive. Other introductory books are perhaps just as good but this one certainly covers the basics.

*Feller, An introduction to probability theory and its applications (Vol. 1):* A classic. Feller goes deeply into discrete probability with many examples along the way. The exercises are especially good.

*Feller, An introduction to probability theory and its applications (Vol. 2); Billingsley, Probability and measure:* Measure-theoretic probability. Have never gotten very far into either of these. 

*Williams, Probability with martingales:* Another treatment of measure-theoretic probability. Concise and clear, but very dense. A good companion book.

** Foundations: Mathematical statistics **

*Rice, Mathematical statistics and data analysis:* The required text for my first statistics course. Covers the basics from the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem to methods of inference.

*Faraway, Linear models with R; Faraway, Extending the linear model with R:* A very practical, hands-on set of books. Works through numerous data analysis examples.

*McCullagh and Nelder, Generalized linear models:* A mix of application and theory. Ties together the various types of regression e.g. linear, logistic, poisson. Another classic, though the examples feel a bit dated.

*Casella and Berger, Statistical inference:* Covers classical statistical theory, typically for first-year PhDs. Good for a second run through mathematical statistics.

*Wasserman, All of statistics; Wasserman, All of nonparametric statistics:* Both are short cookbook-type texts. Focused on theory unlike the Faraway books.

*McLachlan & Peel, Finite Mixture Models:* A modern, extensive and practical guide to fitting mixture models. Full of examples of applications with commonly-used algorithms (EM, MCMC) but uses very dense notation. [NA]

** Topics: Bayesian Statistics **

*Gelman et al, Bayesian data analysis:* A very applied book with numerous data analysis examples. Covers the widely used modern methods.

*Berger, Statistical decision theory and bayesian analysis:* A good mathematical introduction to Bayesian reasoning. Does feel a bit dated. Published in 1993 and there have been many advances in applications since then, esp. in terms of computation.

** Topics: Computation **

*Nocedal and Wright, Numerical optimization:* Written for engineers. A good introduction to general methods for both constrained and unconstrained optimization.

*Boyd and Vandenberghe, Convex optimization:* Excellent book with great exercises. Focused more on mathematical understanding and less on algorithmic implementation. I think this is a good thing, because how many people are going to implement their own solver?

*Sundaram, A first course in optimization theory:* The song you should play while reading this book is Drake's "Started from the Bottom". This book does just that. Starting from the basics of set theory it patiently builds its way towards some of the better proofs in optimization theory in R^n. Very thoughtful writing that explains things carefully. A good course to take after taking real analysis and wanting to apply it to something bigger. [JH]

** Topics: History **

*Salsburg, The lady tasting tea:* Entertaining account of the main personalities behind classical statistics - Fisher, Neyman, Pearson - and their interrelationships.

*Stigler, The history of statistics:* Written by a statistician, goes into the actual mathematics. A comprehensive account up until the time of Galton.  

** Topics: Machine Learning **

*Hastie et al, Elements of statistical learning:* Clearly written introduction to a grab-bag of techniques. Focused on application. Also freely available [online](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)

*Bishop, Pattern recognition and machine learning; Bishop, Neural networks for pattern recognition:* A more mathematical treatment of most of the techniques in the above. The latter focuses on neural networks, an area in which the author is a leading researcher.
